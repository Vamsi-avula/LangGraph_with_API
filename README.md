# LangGraph_with_API
AI Chatbot with Gemini + LangGraph  This project is a Python chatbot that uses LangGraph with Google Gemini and external tools to answer questions and call APIs when needed (weather, distance, search, stock price, CEO lookup). It demonstrates how to build an LLM agent that combines model reasoning with real-time data via tool execution.
